# Model error covariance estimation in weak-constraint 4DVar data assimilation 
This is a Python implementation of a method to estimate model error covariance matrices in a weak-constraint 4DVar data assimilation experiment with the Lorenz 96 model. 

+ LatexFile contains the description of the method and results produced using this implementation.
+ PythonCode contains the code files. 

### How to use this code? 
Download, then open the jupyter notebook in the PythonCode folder to reproduce results outlined in the LatexFile or test the method using different parameters.
